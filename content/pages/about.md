Title: About Me

I'm a computational linguist and passionate about all things language and tech: How do artificial agents produce and understand language, and how can they engage in meaningful dialogue with humans?  How convincing is the language artificial agents produced when we move away from syntax and semantics and examine isolated linguistic phenomena humans employ without a second guess? One such linguistic phenomenon, referring expressions, I examined in my [Bachelor's Thesis](/can-llms-use-context-to-describe-what-they-see.html).


After I'm done trying to coerce those pesky LLMs into linguistic compliance, I change the digital realm to open world adventure games and coerce NPCs to give me their loot.



When it's finally time to log off and touch some grass again, you'll find me roaming on hiking trails, catching some views and my breath or in the kitchen stirring up chaos and dinner.
